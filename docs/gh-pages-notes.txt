To publish the docs using gh-pages, create html subdir under docs and
clone the whole repo from github in html.  Then switch to gh-pages branch.
You should now just have the html generated docs in html.  Now you can run
doxygen and it will update the files in html.  The html subdir now contains
updates to the gh-pages branch which you can git add, commit and push.

TODO: make a script to do all this
