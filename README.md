The two source files, `umqtt.h` and `umqtt.c` are meant to be compiled into
your application.  Much more detailed information is provided in the
above mentioned documentation.

There are some examples in the [umqtt_test](https://github.com/kroesche/umqtt_test)
repo:

* unit_test - detailed unit test against all umqtt functions
* compliance - system level or compliance test against a real MQTT broker
* mcu_app - simple example running on a real MCU

Support
-------

I created this for use in my own projects and make no promises of support.
However if you find a problem feel free to open an issue and I'll take a
look.  Also free free to submit pull request for fixes although if you plan
on submitting major changes it's best to contact me first.
